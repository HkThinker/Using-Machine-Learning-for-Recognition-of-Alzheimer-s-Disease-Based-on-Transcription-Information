# Using-Machine-Learning-for-Recognition-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-Based-on-Transcription-Information
The purpose of this work is to perform analytical and predictive work on Alzheimer's disease based on transcribed text of speech data using machine learning algorithms. The data used in this article was from the ADReSS 2020 Challenge , which contains speech data from Alzheimer's patients and healthy individuals. The problem under study is a binary classification problem. The research approach used in this article was based on a classification model using machine learning. First, complete interviewee texts were extracted from the transcribed texts of speech data, followed by training the model based on the vectorized text features using a random forest classifier, in which the authors used gridsearchCV method to optimize hyperparameters. The classification accuracy of the model exceeded 85%.
